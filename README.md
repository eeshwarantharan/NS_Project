# RSA
The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptography algorithm named after Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. It uses a pair of mathematically linked keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This asymmetric key system ensures secure communication and transactions over insecure networks.
